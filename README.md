# EGM722 Project
 1. Getting Started
 To get started with this project, you must first have ArcGIS Pro installed on your computer as this project revolves around ArcGIS being used with Python. Anaconda is also required to copy the environment.yaml file to, as well as GitHub, to clone the repository onto your desktop. 
 
 
 2. Download and Clone this repository
 - Open the GitHub Desktop app and if you are not currently logged in, then do this.
 - From the home page, select File > Clone Repository
 - A new window should open allowing you to select the URL tab. You should now enter the URL for this repository.
 - You will be asked how you are planning to use this Fork, select ‘For my own Purposes’. 
 
 
 3. Create a Conda environment using the environment.yaml file
 - Open the Anaconda Navigator app
 - Select the Environments tab at the left side of the screen
 - At the bottom of the page, there are options to create new environment, import, clone etc. Select import
 - You will be able to navigate to where you have saved the repository on your local drive, go here and select the environments.yaml file
 - Import this 
 You should now have an environment with the needed programmes installed within where you can successfully run this project
 
 
 4. Lauching Jupyter Notebook
As this project centres around using Python with ArcGIS, you must have an ArcGIS account. You can open Jupyter Nortebook in two ways that will allow this code to run.
To open this using ArcGIS, simply fin the ArcGIS folder, where ArcGIS Pro application is, and the Jupyter Notebook application should also be within this folder. When you open Jupyter Notebook, a command prompt could open. After a few minutes, an internet page should then open with what looks like your computer’s local drive folders. If you navigate to where you saved the repository, you should be able to see all of the previously stated files. You can open the .ipynb code file and run the code. 
Alternatively, you can open Anaconda and create a new environment using the environment.yaml file found within the downloaded repository. To do this, click Import at the bottom of the Environments tab. An import window will appear, allowing you to give your environment a name, while also allowing you to navigate to where the environment.yaml file from the repository tab is found. Click Import, and the environment should begin to set up using the data within the environment file. When it finished, all the necessary programmes needed to run the piece of code should be downloaded. You can now switch to the Home tab in Anaconda Navigator and locate the Jupyter Notebook programme. Launch this. Similar to the ArcGIS way, an internet page should then open with what looks like your computer’s local drive folders. If you navigate to where you saved the repository, you should be able to see all the previously stated files. You can open the .ipynb code file and run the code.
